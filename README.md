Team member names: Michael Krueger, Parker Malmgren, Creed McFall, Zachary Meyer

Project summary:
Smart Pantry is an AI-powered application designed to reduce household food waste. It helps users track pantry and fridge items, predict freshness windows, and recommend recipes based on available ingredients. By offering barcode scanning, expiration reminders, and shared household accounts, the system makes it easier for families, roommates, and individuals to manage food efficiently. The project ultimately saves money, reduces unnecessary food disposal, and promotes sustainable living.

Technology stack:
The project uses Python with Flask or Django for the backend, MySQL for the database, and React or React Native for the frontend. Computer vision is powered by OpenCV/Tesseract, while external APIs handle barcode lookups, recipes, authentication, and maps.

Setup and run locally:
Clone the repository, install dependencies with pip and npm, and set up a MySQL database with the provided schema. Start the backend server (Flask/Django) and then run the frontend (React/React Native) to access the app locally.
